# Process Engineering

---

## What’s hold in this repository?
In the present repository you will find all the documentation needed to assemble a BCN3D Sigmax, from the warehouse to the box. In our commitment to Open Source, we want to be transparent, not only in the design, but also in the processes involved in the BCN3D Sigma manufacture.

Since it’s our first experience producing in an assembly line, we’ve built the structure from the ground up. In the process we have made some mistakes and faced many challenges. But day after day, we improved and deployed a solid system that is allowing us to increase month after month our production capacity in order to satisfy the growing demand.

Read the full story about the Process Engineering performed at the BCN3D facilities at the [BCN3DSigma-Process repository](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3DSigma-Process).

After thousands of Sigmas assembled, the process of assembling 3D printers at our facilities has been optimized and the overall quality of the process has been improved. However, it is necessary to keep on fighting and dealing with unexpected problems. In order to minimise the impact of external elements while ensuring the highest quality outcome, BCN3D operators use several guides, jigs, fixtures and technical documentation. All these files can be checked in this repository.
